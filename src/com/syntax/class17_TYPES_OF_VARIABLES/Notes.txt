Types of variables
There are 3 types pf variables: local, instance, and static

Class Vars{
int age = 10; // instance variable that is declared inside the class
static double weight = 25.5;// static variable
void method(){
String name = "Chris"; // local variable that is declared inside the method

  }
}

Local variable:
if a variable is defined inside a method, loop, switch, or any other block of code, it is called local variable.

Instance variable:
if a variable is not declared inside a method, but it is inside a class, then  it is called an instance variable.

Static variable:
if a variable is not declared inside a method, but it is inside a class, then  it is called an instance variable and
it has static keyword with it then it is called static variable.

When to use which type of variable:

Local Variables:
Local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables because it occupies the computer's memory
for a short amount of time. As soon as the purpose is served, Java destroys it.
    Pros:                        Cons:
Saves memory / Not accessible outside of methods/blocks of code

Instance Variables:
When we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and the information is expected to be different object
to object, we should use the instance variables.
               Pros:                                                    Cons:
Accessible in all the methods of a class / Occupies the computer's memory for longer duration than local variables.

Static Variables:
When we know that information will stay the same for all the objects of a class, we should create a static variable.
                      Pros:                                             Cons:
Single memory location for all objects of a class / Can stay longer in the memory and hold only one value at a time.
