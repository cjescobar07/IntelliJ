Super Keyword:

super is a keyword like "this" keyword, but it refers to the parent class object. We can use the "super" keyword in 3
different ways:
1) To access the super class variables if we have the same named variables in super class and base class.
2)If we have the same method(s) name in parent and child class we can use the super keyword to access the parent class
method, otherwise by default, Java refers to the child class methods.
3) As constructors don't participate in inheritance, we can use super() to call the constructors from the parent class.

Rules:
1) if we have a constructor in the parent class that takes two arguments, we must have a constructor inside the child
class that at least takes those two arguments.
2) We can't use this() and super() inside the same constructor.
3)super can't be used in static methods

Method overloading in Java:
If we have same named methods in a class wth different number of parameters of different sequence of parameters
or different data types of the parameters it is called method overloading

class calculator{

add(int number1, int number2){

  }
add(int number1, double number2){

  }
add(double number2, int number1){

  }
add(double number1, double number2){

  }
add(int number1, int number2, int number3){

  }
}
