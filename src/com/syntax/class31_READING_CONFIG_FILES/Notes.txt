Maps In Java:
Maps are data structures that allows us to store key value pairs.
    1) Searching is efficient
    2) We can use any type of keys like Double String Char etc;
    we are not restricted to integer bases natural indexes

Retrieval:
means getting the data back from a structure

There are many types of maps, but we will be discussing four of them
    1)HashMap
    2 LinkedHashMap
    3) TreeMap
    4) HashTable(old)

HashMap:
    1) HashMap is the fastest map when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data.
    2) Insertion order is not maintained
    3) Widely/Preferable used map

LinkedHashMap:
    1) Maintains the insertion order
    2) Insertion speed is the same as HashMap
    3) Retrieval is the slowest one

TreeMap:
    1) Data is sorted based on the natural order
    2) Insertion speed is the slowest because of the sorting

HashTable:
    is a thread safe data which means it can handle multiple insertions and retrievals at the same time
    from multiple CPU cores, but because of thread safety feature, it is also very slow. If you are sure
    that you will never
