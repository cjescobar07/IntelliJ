Set in Java:
    set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented but many classes for example:
    HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeHashSet.

Properties of Set:
    All the Sets don't allow duplicates

HashSet:
    1) HashSet does not maintain the insertion order
    2) it is the fastest in all Sets
    3) Most widely used Set

LinkedHashSet:
    1) Maintain the insertion order
    2) slows than HashSet but faster than TreeSet, especially the insertions

TreeSets:
    1) Sorts the data in natural order for numbers in increasing order
    2) it is the slowest when it comes to store the data.

When to use which type of Set:
    1) If we don't care about insertion order and data being sorted always use "HashSet"
    2) If we need the insertion order, we don't have much of a choice, but to use LinkedHashSet. If we don't care
    about the insertion order, we can compare it to TreeSet

    LinkedHashSet                       vs                      TreeHashSet
    Insertion is not slow                                       Slowest type of insertion
    Retrieval is super slow                                     Slower than HashSet but faster than LinkedHasSet

I don't care about insertion order but, I care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
HashSet
I care about insertion order but, I don't care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
LinkedHashSet.
if i want to have sorted data all the time?
TreeSet
