Collections Framework in Java:
    collection of classes that helps us manage and manipulate data in a better way.
1) ArrayList
   1) This class has many built-in methods like add(), remove(), clear() etc.
   2) They are Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time

ArrayList<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList --> name of the class
<> --> diamond operator, we specify the data type

Wrapper Classes
byte --> Byte
short --> Short
int --> Integer
double --> Double
char --> character

Why Wrapper Classes
1) We get built-in methods
2) a lot of frameworks don't support primitives

When to use primitive:
       1) When we care about the memory because primitives occupy 4 times less memory as compared to wrapper
       2) Performances

When to use wrapper:
When we care about our ease.

Converting to primitive is boxing
Converting from wrapper to primitive is unboxing
