Inheritance in Java:
Inheritance is a mechanism in Java through which a child class gets the properties and methods
from a parent class

Advantages:
1) Saves time to code
2) Code duplication is reduced
3) Execution time is faster

Disadvantages:
1) Classes are tightly coupled in we change something in parent class, it is also changed in the
child class.

Types of Inheritance:
There are 4 types of inheritance, but Java only supports 3 of them
1) Single
2) Hierarchical
3) Multilevel
4) Multiple (not supported in Java)

Single Inheritance:
In single Inheritance, we have only once child and one parent class or only two classes participate in inheritance
one as child and one as parent.

class Parent{

}
class Child extends Parent{

}

Hierarchical:
In Hierarchical Inheritance, we have a single Parent class and multiple child classes

class Parent{

}

class Child1 extends Parent{

}
class Child2 extends Parent{

}

Multilevel:
We have multiple levels for inheritance, for example, if we have classes A, B , C
class C will be inherited from B and b will be inherited from class A.

Class A{

}
Class B extends A{

}
Class C extends B{

}

super keyword:
super keyword is like the "this" keyword, but it refers to the parent class object from the child class
Example: we can access the field, methods, or constructors of parent class inside the child class using super keyword.
