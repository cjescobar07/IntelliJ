-Abstraction in Java:
    Hiding the implementation details and providing the functionality

-Two methods to achieve abstraction in Java:
    1)Abstract classes
    2) Interfaces

-Abstract:
    Abstract classes are classes with abstract keyword.

-Interfaces:
    Interfaces are the contracts that we create with the help of interface keyword.

-How to decide which one ot use:
1) Prefer the interfaces over abstract class.

2) If two or more classes are closely related to each other, go with abstract class
For example:
    1)If we have to create a Lion class and a horse class. We should go with abstract classes and
    should create an animal abstract class

3) If two classes are not related to each other, go with interface
For example:
    1) If we have to create an iPhone class and an Apple Watch class,we should create an interface if
    we want to have similar behaviors such as Power On, Display Screen, Power off, etc

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the fourth pillar of OOPS. It provides security and better control over the data of a class
We create classes and inside those classes we create private fields
These are methods are called getter/setter methods, and we set and get the values of the class fields with the
help of these methods instead of accessing and modifying them directly.
