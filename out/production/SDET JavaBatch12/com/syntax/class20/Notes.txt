Constructors in Java:
Constructors in Java are special block of code similar to methods that initialize objects of a class

Rules:
    1) they don't have return types, including void
    2) name of the constructor must be the same name as the class
    3) Constructors can't have non access modifiers like static, final, etc.
    4) We can use the access modifiers like public, private, protected with constructors.
    5) If we don't write a constructor in a class, the default constructor is provided by compiler
    6) We can have multiple constructors in a class, but their number of arguments sequence of argument or type of
    arguments should be different.
    7) If we have multiple constructors, then Java decides which constructor to call based on the parameters we pass.

 this keyword:
 "this" keyword is a reserved keyword in Java that we can use to refer to instance varaibles, methods, or constructors
 of a class.
 1) "this" keyword is used to distinguish instance variables, with local variables.
 2) we can use "this" keyword to call the constructor of a class inside other constructors
 3) we can use "this" keyword to call the methods of a class

 Rules:
 1) this() should be the first line inside a constructor
 2) this() can't be used inside the methods
