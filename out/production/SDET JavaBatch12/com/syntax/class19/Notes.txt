Access Modifiers in Java:
Access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class members(fields, methods,constructors, etc.)
and classes within itself in Java
There are 4 access levels and there are keywords that we use to define these access levels. Fourth level is applied
when we don't use any access modifier keyword.
Levels from most restricted to less restricted are:
1) private (keyword is also private)
2) default (no keyword means default access level)
3) protected (keyword is also protected)
4) public (keyword is also public)
Rules:
1)We should always prefer private access modifier for fields because fields contain data and the methods of your
class might use that data to perform some tasks.
Sanity checks before setting the values to the fields our classes and methods might misbehave, also the access of the
data should be restricted so that not every one can access the data.
2) We can't use access modifiers with local variables.

Constructors:
Constructors in Java allows us to set the values of the fields of a class
