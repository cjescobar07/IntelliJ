Maps in Java:
    A Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs.
Benefits:
    1) We can store two values inside the maps
    2) Searching is very efficient
Types of Map:
1) HashMap      2) LinkedHashMap        3) TreeMap
HashMap:
    1) Insertion order is not maintained (downside)
    2) Insertion and retrieval is the fastest
LinkedHashMap:
    1) Insertion order is maintained (upside)
    2) Insertion speed is same as HashMap, but retrieval speed is slowest
TreeMap:
    1) Data is sorted in the natural order by default (upside)
    2) Insertion speed is slowest, retrieval speed is better than LinkedHashMap, but slower than HashMap.
Rules:
    1) We can't convert a collection to a Map.
        Ex: We can't convert a Set to a Map
    2) Duplicate keys are not allowed in Maps
    3) Duplicate values are allowed
