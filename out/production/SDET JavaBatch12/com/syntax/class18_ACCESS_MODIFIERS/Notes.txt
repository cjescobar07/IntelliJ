Can hold only one value for all the objects and stays even longer inside the memory than instance variables.

========================================
Access modifiers:
Access modifiers are keywords in Java that defines from where a certain variable, method, or, class etc. can be accessed.
There are 4 types of access in Java that we can define using three keywords
1. Private
2. Default
3. Protected
4. Public
Types of access are:
1) Private, 2) Default (applied when no keyword is used) 3) Protected 4) Public
private access (keyword is private):
when we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods, or classes these can only be accessed within that class.

Default Access(applied when we don't use any keyword):
When we don't use any of the keywords, default access is applied by Java to those variables methods or classes etc.
which means these things can only be accessed within the same package.

Protected Access(we use the protected class):
When protected access is applied, class members(variables methods etc.) can be accessed from other packages, but only
in the classes that participate inheritance.

Public Access (public keyword):
Public access means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project.
